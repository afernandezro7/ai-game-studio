# AI Game Studio — Studio-Level Documentation

This folder contains documentation that applies to the **entire studio**, not a specific game.

## Structure

├── README.md              ← You are here

```

## Game-Specific Docs

Each game has its own `docs/` folder inside `games/<game-id>/docs/`. See:
